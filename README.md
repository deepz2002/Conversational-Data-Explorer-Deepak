## üí° Sample Interactions

### Basic Data Exploration
```
User: "Upload sales_data.csv and describe the data"
Agent: "I've loaded your dataset with 1,250 rows and 8 columns. The data contains:
        - Customer information (customer_name, region)
        - Sales metrics (total_revenue, units_sold)
        - Time data (order_date)
        - Product details (product_category, price_per_unit)"
```

### Smart Analysis
```
User: "Show me top 5 customers by sales"
Agent: [Automatically detects customer_name and total_revenue columns]
        "Here are the top 5 customers by total revenue:
        
        | Customer Name    | Total Revenue |
        |------------------|---------------|
        | TechCorp Inc     | $125,430     |
        | Global Solutions | $98,750      |
        | ... "
        
        [Generates bar chart visualization]
```

### Trend Analysis
```
User: "Plot revenue trends over time"
Agent: [Detects order_date and total_revenue, creates time series]
        "Here's the revenue trend analysis showing monthly patterns:
        
        [Interactive line chart showing revenue over time]
        
        Key insights: Revenue shows seasonal patterns with peaks in Q4..."
```

Agent: "Based on your data, I can show you several interesting analyses:
        1. Revenue trends by region over time
        2. Top performing product categories
        3. Customer purchase patterns and seasonality
        
        Which would you like to explore first?"
```
